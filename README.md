# Predictive Analysis of Car Sales using Linear Regression with Sklearn

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to utilize linear regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to predict car sales for a leading car manufacturing company. By leveraging the powerful Sklearn library, we will build a robust predictive model that analyzes historical sales data to forecast future sales trends.

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to predict future car sales based on historical data. By using linear regression, we aim to understand the relationship between various factors and car sales, and use this relationship to make accurate predictions.

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project includes historical sales data from a leading car manufacturing company. This data is crucial for training the linear regression model.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Model Building

Using the Sklearn library, we implement a linear regression model. The key steps involved are:

1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Preparing the data for training
3. Training the linear regression model
4. Making predictions on the test data

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²) score

These metrics help in understanding the accuracy and reliability of the model.

## Results

The predictive model successfully identifies trends and patterns in historical sales data, providing valuable insights for forecasting future car sales. The results can be used by the company to make informed business decisions.
